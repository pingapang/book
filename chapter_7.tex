\chapter{Assumptions of linear models}\label{chap:assumptions}


\section{Introduction}
Linear models are models. A model describes the relationship between two or more variables. A good model gives a valid summary of what the relationship between the variables looks like. Let's look at a very simple example of two variables: height and weight. In a sample of 100 children from a distant country, we find 100 combinations of height in cms and weight in kilograms that are depicted in the scatterplot in Figure \ref{fig:ass_1}
