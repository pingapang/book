Analyzing data using linear models, by St√©phanie M. van den Berg


This is a textbook used in several data analysis courses at the University of Twente, in the lovely town of Enschede, the Netherlands. The first editions focused only on applications with SPSS, future editions will only focus on applications with R. The current edition (4th) is mostly SPSS, with some R. The book aims to discuss (generalized) linear (mixed) models in a non-algebraic way (no matrix algebra), and to teach data analytical practice in social sciences with as little mathematical statistics as possible, but still get a proper understanding of what one is doing and how to interpret results. That's a challenge of course, so if you have ideas and suggestions, drop me a line.
